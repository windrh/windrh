### 🌟🤖 Project AICD

**Project AICD** - A personal endeavor to learn and develop machine learning from scratch. This is the centerpiece of my work, and I'm excited to share it with you.

#### More Details #### 

##### My crowning acheivement is the creation of something called Project AICD. It stands for Artificial Intelligence Creation and Development. I have started from scratch and learned the fundamentals of machine learning on my own, with a product to show for it. This code is continually evolving as I learn more and more about Artificial Intelligence. At the moment, it can learn simple mathematical functions after being fine tuned for data input. My future aspirations for the project include developing code that can be trained on real life data. I also plan on transfering it to C or C# as a personal challenge and way to make it run faster once ready for large scale employment ####
