## 🐾 Pets

I love animals, and I've helped take care of my sisters' pet guinea pigs named Brownie, Sunny, Rascal, Little Snickers, and Kevin! They are all adorable and fun to be around. Taking care of them has taught me responsibility and patience, and I always look forward to spending time with them.
